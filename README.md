# Assignment 3 - Python Programs

This repository contains two Python programs created as part of Assignment 3. Each program focuses on mathematical operations using user input and Python's built-in functions and libraries.

## Task 1: Factorial Using a Function

**Filename:** `task_1assignment_3.py`

### Description:
This program calculates the **factorial** of a user-entered number using a custom function.

### Functionality:
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Defines a function `factorial(a)` which:
  - Uses a loop to calculate the factorial by multiplying numbers in descending order.
- Returns and displays the factorial result.

## Task 2: Math Module Operations

**Filename:** `task_2assignment_3.py`

### Description:
This program demonstrates the use of Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module by performing multiple operations on user input.

### Functionality:
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Calculates and prints:
  - The **square root** of the number.
  - The **logarithm** (natural log) of the number.
  - The **sine** of the number in radians.

> Note: The program uses functions from the `math` module such as `math.sqrt()`, `math.log()`, and `math.sin()`.
